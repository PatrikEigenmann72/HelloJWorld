## Author

My name is Patrik Eigenmann. After nine years as a professional software engineer, I switched careers to live sound. I still code on the side—projects like Tone3 keep me curious, challenged, and mentally sharp.
These tools aren’t polished products backed by teams. They’re personal explorations, built to deepen my understanding and share something useful with others. If you’d like to support what I do, you can donate to p.eigenmann@gmx.net via PayPal. I’d truly appreciate it.
Tone3 is and always will be free—licensed under the GNU Public License v3.0. Feel free to modify it, break it, rebuild it, or run it just as it is. Thanks for checking it out.
